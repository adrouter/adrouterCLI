# AdRouterCLI coding agent

Read the [canonical product guide](https://github.com/adrouter/adrouterCLI/blob/main/docs/about.md)
for the generated model table and official runtime contract.

This package provides the `adrouter` and `adrouter-profile` executables. AdRouterCLI is derived from [Pi](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono) by Mario Zechner and preserves Pi's original MIT license and copyright.

The public `0.81.0-beta.20` source and single bundled npm package are MIT licensed. Access to the hosted gateway remains invite-only.

```sh
npm install --global --ignore-scripts @adrouter/cli@beta
adrouter
```

At first launch, review the workspace trust prompt and run `/login adrouter`. Sign in at the opened AdRouter website, choose the native Done action, and approve the matching installation code in the WebUI; Open, Copy, and Quit remain available as recovery actions. The CLI keeps its approved Ed25519 key and rotating refresh credential in user-only file-protected storage, removes pending keys after failed attempts, and keeps access tokens in memory. The hosted coding surface supports `deepseek-v4-flash`, `deepseek-v4-pro`, `mimo-v2.5`, `mimo-v2.5-pro`, `agnes-2.0-flash`, and `agnes-2.5-flash`. Run `/ads` to inspect or immediately disable display-only sponsorship, and `/logout adrouter` to revoke and remove the installation.

Global state is stored under `~/.adrouter/agent`; project configuration is stored under `.adrouter/`. AdRouterCLI preserves user-approved command execution.

Full installation, usage, configuration, privacy, security, troubleshooting, and release documentation is maintained in the [public repository](https://github.com/adrouter/adrouterCLI#readme).
