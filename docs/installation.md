# Installation

AdRouterCLI requires Node.js 22.19 or newer. On macOS and Linux, install Node with the official installer or a maintained version manager. On Windows, install Node for all users or ensure the per-user npm binary directory is on `PATH`.

```sh
npm install --global --ignore-scripts @adrouter/cli@beta
adrouter --version
adrouter --help
adrouter --json doctor
```

This installs one public package. Its private `@adrouter/ai`, `@adrouter/tui`,
and `@adrouter/agent-core` runtime packages are embedded in the CLI tarball and
are not fetched as separate AdRouter registry packages.

Hosted authentication is installation-bound. `/login adrouter` first opens and prints the AdRouter
sign-in page. After the user confirms that browser sign-in is complete with the native Done action, the CLI
creates an Ed25519 key, sends the installation request, and opens and prints the user-approval page.
An already-open signed-in AdRouter tab receives the same approval request as a modal. Failed, denied,
cancelled, or interrupted attempts remove that pending key and best-effort cancel server state, so
restarting and running `/login adrouter` begins cleanly. The approved private key plus rotating refresh credential are stored
with user-only file permissions. Access tokens are not persisted. This is classified as
`file_protected`, not OS-keychain encrypted; use `/logout adrouter` before disposing of a machine and
review remote installations in the WebUI if revocation could not be confirmed.

The installed AdRouter model catalog is usable offline and contains `agnes-2.0-flash`,
`agnes-2.5-flash`, `agnes-2.5-pro`, `agnes-2.5-pro-alpha`, `deepseek-v4-flash`,
`deepseek-v4-pro`, `mimo-v2.5`, and `mimo-v2.5-pro`. Their generated model-specific context, input,
and output tuples are listed in the [product guide](about.md#official-model-catalog). Router keeps a
4,096-token omitted-output and default account ceiling even though explicit model maxima are higher.
Hosted discovery may validate that contract but must not silently alter it and delay local compaction.

The doctor result must report `"installation":{"kind":"packaged","deployable":true}`
for a supported deployment. A source-linked or incomplete installation can run
some metadata commands but is not deployment-qualified.

If the command is missing, inspect `npm prefix --global`. Add its executable directory to your shell `PATH`; on Windows this is commonly the npm prefix itself, while Unix installations commonly use its `bin` directory. Restart the terminal after changing `PATH`.

For a published native archive, download the archive, `SHA256SUMS`, and SBOM from the same prerelease. Confirm the asset is listed as eligible in `release-manifest.json`, then run `sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS` (or `shasum -a 256 -c SHA256SUMS` on macOS) and `gh attestation verify <asset> --repo adrouter/adrouterCLI`. Do not install an artifact marked blocked.

Upgrade with:

```sh
npm install --global --ignore-scripts @adrouter/cli@beta
```

Uninstall with:

```sh
npm uninstall --global @adrouter/cli
```

Uninstalling does not remove `~/.adrouter/agent`. Back it up before deleting it. Never use Gatekeeper or SmartScreen bypass instructions; a missing or invalid platform signature is a release defect.
