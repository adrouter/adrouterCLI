# Troubleshooting

Run `adrouter --json doctor` first. It reports configuration, reachability, pending enrollment, refresh health, and signed-request capability without printing private keys, access/refresh credentials, codes, nonces, proofs, or full fingerprints.

For deployments, `installation.deployable` must be `true`. If doctor reports
`source-linked`, `unknown`, or an unready bundled dependency, reinstall the
exact packaged version:

```sh
npm install --global --ignore-scripts @adrouter/cli@0.81.0-beta.14
```

Use `ADROUTER_BUNDLED_FEATURES=off` only as an explicit core-only recovery
mode; extension commands, tools, and skills are unavailable in that mode.

- Authentication: a pending enrollment is removed when login fails or is cancelled. If the CLI was terminated mid-login, run `/login adrouter` again; it discards the old pending key and creates a clean approval request after browser sign-in. If diagnostics report an expired family, invalid approved key, or `reenrollmentRequired`, run `/logout adrouter`, review remote installations in the WebUI, and enroll again. A lost approved private key cannot be recovered from the server.
- Signed proof rejection: enable automatic date, time, and time-zone synchronization on the computer, then retry. AdRouterCLI reports likely clock drift separately from account, client-policy, and developer-access rejection.
- Quota or budget: stop retrying and ask the beta operator to inspect the tester's spend cap.
- Network: verify DNS, TLS interception, proxy settings, and access to `api-staging.adrouter.co`.
- Terminal: reproduce in a current terminal with `TERM` set correctly; include dimensions and OS, not terminal history.
- Extensions: disable project resources, then bundled or user extensions one at a time.
- Model selection: use `agnes-2.0-flash`, `agnes-2.5-flash`, `agnes-2.5-pro`,
  `agnes-2.5-pro-alpha`, `deepseek-v4-flash`, `deepseek-v4-pro`, `mimo-v2.5`, or `mimo-v2.5-pro`
  for the hosted beta.
- Context limits: hosted context is 524,288 or 1,048,576 tokens, maximum input ranges from 458,752
  to 917,504, and maximum output ranges from 65,536 to 196,608. A growing session compacts at the
  lower of the selected model's maximum input and its context minus the 16,384-token reserve. Router
  still defaults omitted output and new account ceilings to 4,096. If one compact-and-retry still
  reports that the context is too large, run `/compact`, then
  reduce or split the largest message, pasted file, tool schema, or tool result. A single irreducible
  input cannot be made sendable by summarizing older history. Do not blindly retry a partial streamed
  response; the CLI deliberately refuses to replay it.

For a bug report, include version, OS/architecture, Node version, exact safe reproduction steps, expected and actual behavior, and redacted diagnostics. Never attach credentials, raw sessions, prompts, model output, tool payloads, or personal paths.
