Sponsorship selection and rendering stay outside model and tool context. The backend, WebUI, Electron agent, landing page, and infrastructure are external to this repository.

## Hosted context admission

The generated AdRouter catalog is the deterministic offline source for all six hosted model limits:
131,072 total tokens, 126,976 maximum input tokens, and 4,096 maximum output tokens. Before an
official hosted request, the provider conservatively estimates the full serialized model context,
including the system prompt, conversation, multibyte text, tool schemas, and tool results. The
default 16,384-token compaction reserve makes the proactive boundary 114,688 estimated tokens.

An authoritative HTTP 413 with structured code `input_limit_exceeded` is eligible for one automatic
compact-and-retry only when it arrived before any response stream event. The synthetic assistant
error is retained in append-only session history but removed from the retry context. Any consumed
ad, text, thinking, tool-call, settlement, or done event makes the turn non-replayable. Other 413,
authentication, quota, policy, rate-limit, provider, transport, and abort failures are not treated as
context overflow. Sponsor and settlement side-channel data are never serialized into compaction
summaries.
